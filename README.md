C# Expression parsing and evaluation<br>
How to use
```C#
Parser.parse(expression)
```
Will execute the expression and give you a double.


### ! Expression should be written in the following format : WhiteSpaces between every operators or operands except for negative numbers.<br>
New : unary expression "Negative" and "Factorial" support added and functionnal. <br>
Updated : Expression handling and parsing, using RPN approach with some tweaks.<br>
<br>
I reckon there is room for improvement<br>
Up next :<br>
  -Parsing improvement.<br>
  -Whitespace restriction removal.<br>
  -Code Quality improvement (especialy for the parsing part)<br>
  -Better use of IExpressions.
